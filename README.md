# TRIBE
TRIBE (Targets of RNA-binding proteins Identified By Editing) is a technique used for identification transcripts that are target of RNA binding protein (RBP) in vivo. TRIBE couples an RBP to the catalytic domain of the Drosophila RNA editing enzyme ADAR and expresses the fusion protein in vivo, RBP targets are marked with novel RNA editing events and identified by sequencing RNA. This repository provides the necessary computational pipeline needed to analyze these RNA sequencing libraries.
